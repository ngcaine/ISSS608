# The Task

In this take-home exercise, you are required to apply appropriate interactivity and animation methods you had learned in last week lesson to design an age-sex pyramid based data visualisation to show the changes of demographic structure of Singapore by age cohort and gender between 2000-2020 at planning area level.  

For this task, the data sets entitle *Singapore Residents by Planning Area / Subzone, Age Group, Sex and Type of Dwelling, June 2000-2010* and *Singapore Residents by Planning Area / Subzone, Age Group, Sex and Type of Dwelling, June 2011-2020* should be used.  These data sets are available at [Department of Statistics](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/) home page.   

### Word of advice

This is to ensure that you are not going to repeat the same mistake again.
